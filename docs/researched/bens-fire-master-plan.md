## Phase 3: Tax Optimization (Ongoing)

### Tax-Efficient Account Strategy

**Annual Contribution Priority:**
```
1. ISA: £20,000/year (tax-free growth + withdrawals)
   → All investment gains tax-free forever
   
2. SIPP: £10,000+/year (20% tax relief)
   → £10,000 contribution = £12,500 in pension
   → Locked until age 55
   
3. LISA: £4,000/year (25% bonus)
   → If buying first home
   → £4,000 becomes £5,000
   
4. GIA: Remainder (taxable)
   → Use £6,000 CGT allowance
   → Tax-loss harvest to minimize
```

**Ben's Tax Strategy:**

| Account | Annual Target | Tax Benefit |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| ISA | £20,000 | 100% tax-free |
| SIPP | £10,000 | 20% boost (£2,000 free) |
| LISA | £4,000 | 25% bonus (£1,000 free) |
| **Total Tax-Advantaged** | **£34,000** | **£3,000+ saved/year** |

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

**How It Works:**
1. Atlas scans portfolio daily for underwater positions
2. Identifies gains you're planning to realize
3. Sells losing positions to offset gains
4. Immediately reinvests in similar (not identical) ETF

**Example:**
```
Scenario: You want to sell £10,000 of VUSA (gain: £3,000)

Without Harvesting:
- CGT on £3,000 gain = £600 tax (20%)

With Harvesting:
- Atlas finds £2,500 loss in GBPX
- Sell GBPX, realize £2,500 loss
- Net gain: £3,000 - £2,500 = £500
- CGT on £500 = £100 tax
- Savings: £500 per transaction

Reinvest:
- Buy VUKE (similar UK exposure) immediately
- Maintain allocation, but harvested tax loss
```

**Atlas Tax Commands:**
```
"Show tax-loss harvest opportunities"
"Calculate tax impact of selling [TICKER]"
"Optimize my tax position for year-end"
"What's my CGT liability this tax year?"
```

## Phase 6: Risk Management

### Portfolio Risk Controls

**Rebalancing Rules:**
```
Monthly Check:
- If allocation drifts >5% from target → Rebalance
- Tax-loss harvest before rebalancing
- Rebalance using new contributions first (avoid selling)

Market Crash Protocol:
- DO NOT panic sell
- If market drops >20%: Add extra £1,000 if available
- If market drops >30%: Review allocation, consider increasing stocks
- Historical recovery: Average bear market lasts 9 months
```

**Diversification Guardrails:**
```
Maximum Single Stock: 5% of portfolio
Maximum Single Sector: 25% of portfolio
Maximum Crypto: 10% of portfolio
Minimum Cash Buffer: 5% of portfolio
```

### Income Risk Management

**Freelance Diversification:**
```
Never rely on single client >30% of income
Build retainer agreements (recurring revenue)
Keep 3-month expense buffer
Diversify platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, direct clients)
```

**Side Hustle Risk:**
```
Don't quit day job until 6 months runway
Start small, validate before scaling
Keep overhead low (no office, minimal tools)
Document systems for potential sale/handoff
```

## Quick Reference Card

### The Formula
```
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25
Your Target = £40,000 × 25 = £1,000,000
```

### The Levers (In Order of Impact)
```
1. Savings Rate: +10% = 2-3 years faster to FIRE
2. Income Growth: 2× income = 2-3 years faster
3. Investment Returns: Only +1-2 years (less impactful early)
4. Expense Reduction: £1 saved = £25 less needed
```

### Monthly Checklist
```
□ Check portfolio value
□ Review savings rate
□ Track income streams
□ Update FIRE projection
□ Rebalance if needed
□ Tax-loss harvest check
□ Celebrate wins!
```

### Emergency Protocol
```
Market Crash: DON'T SELL. Add more if possible.
Income Drop: Tap emergency fund, reduce expenses, hustle harder.
Unexpected Expense: Use cash buffer, not investments.
Temptation to Spend: Remember: £100 spent = £2,500 less at FIRE.
```

3. **Atlas:** Automated tracking saves 20+ hrs/month
4. **Low Expenses:** Student lifestyle → high savings rate possible
5. **UK Tax Benefits:** ISA/SIPP/LISA = massive tax savings
