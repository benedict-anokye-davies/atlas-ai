## ⚡ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

To make this work:

1. **Perfect PRD.md**
   - Clear, specific tasks
   - Each task: 5-30 minutes
   - Well-ordered dependencies
   - Measurable success criteria

2. **API Keys Ready**
   - Get all 6 keys before starting
   - Store in .env file
   - Don't commit to Git

3. **Monitor Early**
   - Run ./ralph-once.sh first (test)
   - Fix any issues
   - Then go to afk-ralph.sh (autonomous)

4. **Task Sizing**
   - Too big = Claude struggles
   - Too small = inefficient
   - Goldilocks: 5-30 min per task

5. **Clear Expectations**
   - One feature per iteration
   - Test before committing
   - Commit message includes what changed

---

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS (AVOID THESE)

❌ **Don't**: Start with vague tasks  
✅ **Do**: Write specific, measurable tasks

❌ **Don't**: Forget to test before committing  
✅ **Do**: Every iteration includes testing

❌ **Don't**: Skip one-task-per-iteration rule  
✅ **Do**: Strictly enforce one feature per commit

❌ **Don't**: Run enormous Ralph loops first  
✅ **Do**: Test with ralph-once.sh first

❌ **Don't**: Ignore error messages  
✅ **Do**: Check build.log if something fails
